# REEL RIOT AR

An AR fishing game you can play just about anywhere!

Point your deviceâ€™s camera at any flat surface to spawn a pool of water and start fishing. Carefully tap the screen to reel in your catch and secure your fish. The rarer the fish, the harder to catch; be ready to frantically mash!
